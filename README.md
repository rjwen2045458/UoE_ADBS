The mechanism of join operator is specifically explained in comments of class JoinOperator. The mechanism of extracting join conditions from the WHERE clause is specifically explained in the comments of class myExpressionDePaser. In this project, a proper-designed data structure tuple in class Tuple contributes a lot. The tuple contains most required information to match extracted join condition information, which relieves pressure of other components in the system to tracing necessary information. The tuple structure can be found in comments of class Tuple. Generally speaking, the operating mechanism of this database system is explained by the comments in code.
